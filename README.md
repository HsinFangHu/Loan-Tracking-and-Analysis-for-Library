## Description
The Book Lovers & Co. library has implemented an efficient system using SQLite to track all book loans and library loan transactions. This project aims to streamline and improve the management of the library's loan process, providing valuable insights into patronage, collection us age, and financial performance.

The database consists of several tables, including "Book," "Patron," "Address," and "Loan_Trans." The "Book" table contains information about each book, such as call number, title, and subject. The "Patron" table stores details about library patrons, including their personal information and date of birth. The "Address" table maintains addresses associated with each patron. The "Loan_Trans" table records loan transactions, including the patron ID, book call number, loan fee, loan fee payment status, and dates of check-out and return.

Overall, by leveraging this comprehensive database, the library can generate valuable insights and reports to inform decision-making and enhance library operations. The analysis report provides an overview of the library's performance, focusing on patronage, collection usage, and financial aspects.


## Objectives
Evaluate Patronage: Assess the patronage of the library by analyzing the number of patrons, patron demographics, patron engagement, and borrowing patterns. This helps understand the library's reach and effectiveness in serving its community.

Understand Collection Usage: Analyze the circulation statistics, popular books, and collection growth to gain insights into the library's collection usage. This assists in collection development decisions and identifying areas of high demand.

Monitor Financial Performance: Evaluate the library's financial performance by examining revenue from loan fees, expenses, fines, and total uncollected fines. This provides an overview of the library's financial health and highlights potential areas for improvement.

Identify Late Returns and Fines: Analyze late returns, fines, and outstanding fines to identify patterns and trends. This helps the library improve loan policies, implement strategies for fine collection, and enhance patron awareness of due dates and responsibilities.
